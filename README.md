# Humerus Analysis

We evaluate the evidence supporting Hermon Bumpus' 1899 claim of natural selection being at play by testing the difference of sample means among House Sparrow wing bones.

## Description

Biologist Hermon Bumpus asserted that natural selection was present among species of the animal kingdom in 1899. As evidence, he presented findings from a recent study involving male House Sparrows. Following an abnormally severe winter storm, House Sparrows were collected and their humerus bones measured and documented for birds that both survived and perished in the storm.

Our goal is to analyze the sampled data and evaluate the evidence supporting Bumpus' alternative hypothesis that the difference of sample mean wing sizes extends to the population and that such is evidence of natural selection at work in the animal kingdom.

We'll analyze the dataset graphically, make stastically hypotheses/conclusions, evaluate assumptions, and address the scope of inference. You'll find the analysis file (.R) within the repository and a full written report of the findings at the below blog post.
